# üíª Algorithms 
This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in **Algorithms using C++**. Here, I document all the exercises I completed as part of my Algorithms course.

>Through this subject, I had the opportunity to learn fundamental algorithms to solve important problems, such as finding the shortest path using **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm**, and graph traversal with **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
>I also explored the challenges and limitations that arise when applying these techniques.This subject helped me improve my logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and ability to visualize algorithms.

# üóÇÔ∏è Folders
The repository is organized into folders, each representing a different type of activity or material developed during the course ‚Äî such as mind maps, exercises, ...

- ## Practical Activities (APs)
  [Practical Activities](https://github.com/renanrv4/CIN0140/tree/master/APs) -
 This folder contains all the hands-on exercises I completed to learn the fundamental concepts covered in the course.

- ## Algorithms (Algoritmos)
  [Data Structures](https://github.com/renanrv4/CIN0140/tree/master/Algoritmos) -
  Here you'll find all the algorithms implementations that I implemented during the whole course.

- ## Practical Lists (LPs)
  [Practical Lists](https://github.com/renanrv4/CIN0140/tree/master/LPs) -
  A collection of exercises that helped me apply my knowledge in various problem-solving scenarios.

- ## Mind Maps (MMs)
  [Mind Maps](https://github.com/renanrv4/CIN0140/tree/master/MMs) -
  This folder contains all the mind maps that I did to learn and review all the contents that I learned.
